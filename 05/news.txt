A resolution sponsored by Japan that calls for the total elimination of nuclear weapons passed in a United Nations committee Oct. 27, but with significantly less support than in past years.
Tokyo has put forward similar resolutions for the past 24 years. The latest version was endorsed by 144 countries â€” 23 fewer than the number of states who endorsed last year's. Abstentions jumped to 27 this year from 17 last year.
Austria supported last year's version but abstained this year, saying the new version was weaker in important ways.
